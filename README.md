# Ontology-Based Corner Case Generation in Autonomous Driving 

To run the notebooks, Python 3.7 and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is required. For initialization, run in the project's root folder:
```
poetry shell
poetry install
jupyter lab
```

In the notebooks, the setups of the experiments reported on in the paper are presented and documented. Please note, that the generator draws samples from the output space. The results reported on in the paper can be found in the folder `experiments-paper`.
